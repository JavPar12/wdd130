    <h2>Luis Pardo</h2>
    <p>My name is Luis, and currently I am looking to learn software development. 
        Some of the things I enjoy doing are sports like football, triathlon, and basketball, as well as playing a bit of guitar and drawing. 
        I am not currently married, in fact, I am single, but I hope to achieve that goal soon. </p>
    <p>I am not currently employed, I am focusing on studying. I am seeking to complete my degree in WDD. 
        I am just starting out in the world of programming, as I consider it a tool that will help me secure a good job in the future and provide for my family.</p> 
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 4 years since I was baptized, and I returned from my mission a year ago. 
        I hope to work together with all of you and, if circumstances permit, even become friends. I enjoy meeting new people.</p>
